yarn - Yet Another Random Number
My first attempt at a java-based numerical library.

Main points:
- The project will use JDK 1.6.
- The project is written in Java using NetBeans 6.8.
- A unit tests will be added using JUnit 4.5, available from within NetBeans 6.8.
- Documentation will be written using JavaDoc from within NetBeans 6.8.
- Code coverage is measured using Cobertura 1.9. (See http://cobertura.sourceforge.net/)

Declaration of intent:
- The project is mainly a learning-space for me for the following:
    - Mathematics and Numerics.
    - Application of Design Patterns (see GoF-book) to mathematics and numerics.
    - Programming Principles.
    - Produtivity enhancing tools and techniques.
